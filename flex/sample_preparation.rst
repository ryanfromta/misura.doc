Sample preparation for the Absolute Optical Fleximeter
==============================================================

The absolute fleximeter frames three points on the bottom side of the sample with three independent optics.

In order to achive the best focus the sample should be:
    
    * aligned to the end of the middle holding rods, in such a way that the border distances from the optics are equal and the focus distance is the same
