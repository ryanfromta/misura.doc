In order to follow the tutorial you should:
	
	* Download and Install Misura\ |trade|.
	* Get the sample file |smp| and save it to a known location (eg: your Desktop)

=========================
Opening the output file
=========================

1. Run ``browser.exe`` application from the folder where you extracted |m|, or run the link you created on your desktop.
2. In the **Recent data sources** window, under the first column **Recent files**, click on **Add** button.
3. Browse to the location where you downloaded |smp|, select and open it.
4. The loading process will start. If the file is considerably big (several GB) or located on network or slow storage drive, it may take several seconds to open.
5. The file is displayed on a new tab, on the right of the **Databases** tab.

The test file tab is divided in three areas:

* A menu bar in the upper part of the window
* A right area called **Test Configuration**. It is divided in at least 4 vertical tabs: **Measure**, **Thermal Cycle**, **Sample0** and **Results**.
* A central area displaying movable and resizable sub-windows, where you see the **Data Plot** window.
