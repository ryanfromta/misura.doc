Test Window
==================================
The |m| Test Window opens in Browser's tabs once a test has been selected. 

Its appearance is very similar to the :ref:`live_acquisition` window, with a central area displaying a plot and a lateral area showing test configurations and data Navigator.

The values contained in the configuration tabs (Measure, Sample 0...n, Thermal Cycle) are the ones recorded at the end of the test.

---------------------
Basic Plotting and Embedding
---------------------
At the opening of the test, a standard plot is displayed. In order to interact with this plot, switch to ``Results`` tab in the left panel.

You can operate on the plot with the usual Navigator functions (un/plotting a curve, smoothing, deriving, etc). You can also create a test report on a new plot page. 

Once you are satisfied by your plot, you can permanently save into the test file. 

* From ``Measure`` menu, click on ``Plots`` submenu.
* Select ``Save new plot``. Give a name to your plot.
* Your new plot will appear in the ``Plots`` submenu.

Saved plots can be recalled, overwriting any current plot.

---------------------
Re-evaluation of scripts
---------------------
The logic by which characteristic or important points are identified during the test is saved onto the test file. Through the Browser it is possible to change and replay this logic, for research purposes. 

The replay is accessible from the  ``Measure`` menu, at the ``Re-evaluate standards`` action. All affected values will be recalculated.
