Measurement Apps
======================================

|m| software can run different measurement functions, depending on its version and on your hardware capabilities. Each measurement is controlled by a specific **App** which allows the user to access relevant configuration options, frame the samples on cameras, start/stop the test and follow the analysis real-time. 

Measurement Apps are accessible through the :ref:`live_acquisition` executable.

Use this index to navigate to the desired measurement function. 

.. hint:: Availability of measurement functions depends on your hardware and software version.
