Live Acquisition
==================================

Live Acquisition functionality allows you to analyze data while being acquired.

When you launch Aqcuisition software, you have to select a server to connect to. In a normal environment, the server will be:

    https://172.16.8.68:3880/RPC

A username and a password will be prompted.

After a succesful connection you will be shown a list with available instruments, a button for each instrument. Click the corresponding button to select your desired instrument.

Once the instrument is selected, the machine will start its set up.
A "Pending Tasks" dialog will appear, showing some details about what is happening.
This operation can take up to a couple of minute, depending on the instrument. Any interaction with the application is discouraged until when the dialog disappears.
