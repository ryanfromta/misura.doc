|m| Navigator
=============


|m| Navigator is a tree view, located on the right of the application by default.

It contains all the currently loaded datasets, and it's an entry point for data manipulation.
When you right click on a curve or group of curves, you get a menu that lists all the possible operations you can perform on that curve.
